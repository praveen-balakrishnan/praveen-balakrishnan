# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Praveen!

I am a **Mathematics and Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Oxford**, interested in **operating systems and low-level programming**.

I'm currently working on [xpOS](https://github.com/praveen-balakrishnan/xpOS), my own hobbyist x86-64 operating system. Try it out at your own risk!
